<p>Our next speaker regularly presents at numerous national conferences, and he's bringing one of his presentations to our JUG! This special event will <strong>not</strong> be on Tuesday, as is usual, but on Wednesday, 1 June, at Rackspace Hosting. A map and parking instructions will be posted soon. Details below. <a href="#how">Maps further down</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A number of event posters have been distributed with conflicting times listed. The correct time is <strong>5:30</strong>, not 6:00 as shown on the pull-tabs at the bottom of the poster.</p>
<h2>Next Meeting--1 June</h2>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Enter the Gradle</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> In the Java build space, first there was ANT, which provided a reliable way to build without an IDE. Then there was Maven, which provided standardization in build life cycles and dependency management. Now... Enter the Gradle, which provides convention over configuration approach to the build process and an approach at building that isn't based on XML.</p>
<p>This session assumes no familiarly with Gradle as it introduces this new approach at building projects. It is very helpful to be able to read and understand groovy to get the most from the session. This session will look at multi-language or polyglot projects, as well as integration to ANT and Maven. It will conclude with building custom plugins for the Gradle build process.</p>
