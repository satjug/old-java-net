<h1>One hour meetings</h1>
<p>SATJUG members prefer nice, short, one-hour meetings. Shoot for a 45-minute presentation so there's time for some admin up front and for sponsors to talk for a few minutes before things get rolling. If you're going to have trouble wrapping up by 7:00, we'll find somewhere to take a break, do the drawing for the door prizes, and let people leave who need to. After that, you can finish up your presentation. Unless special accommodations have been made, we <strong>will</strong> break at or near 7:00.</p>

<h1>Check the equipment</h1>
<p>We start at 6:00. I'm usually there by 5:30. Try to show up at least 15 minutes early to get hooked up to the projector and make sure everything is working. If feasible, I recommend you email me a copy of your presentation ahead of time so that I can have it ready to go on my laptop in case disaster should strike yours: <a href="mailto:rds6235@gmail.com">rds6253@gmail.com</a> <strong>If you need internet access</strong> make sure you get it before start time! On that note, don't assume you'll have a blazing fast connection. If your demo needs lots of online material, download it ahead of time.</p>

<h1>Know your material</h1>
<p>As a courtesy to all SATJUG members who are giving up an evening to come see your presentation, please be prepared to give it without reading straight from the slides. Know what you're talking well enough to speak confidently on the subject and field basic questions.</p>

<h1>Stay in touch</h1>
<p>Feel free to call or email me with any questions. Especially if you aren't going to be able to make it to the meeting or if you're going to be late for whatever reason, please call and let me know as soon as you can: 210-394-3719 <a href="mailto:rds6235@gmail.com">rds6253@gmail.com</a></p>

<h1>Have fun</h1>
<p>This is an easy crowd. We're all just developers who are interested in learning new stuff. Take a deep breath, relax, and just show us why it's cool.</p>

<h1>The short and sweet</h1>
<p>A quick list of the major points above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meeting time is 6:00 to 7:00; be prepared to stop or be stopped at 7:00.</li>
  <li>Arrive by 5:45 to prep equipment.</li>
  <li>Check your internet connection! Do large downloads before you arrive.</li>
  <li>Know your material.</li>
  <li>Contact me if you need anything.</li>
</ul>
