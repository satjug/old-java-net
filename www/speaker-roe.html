<h1>One hour meetings</h1>
<p>SATJUG member prefer nice, short, one-hour meetings. Shoot for a 45-minute presentation so there's time for some admin up front and for sponsors to talk for a few minutes before things get rolling. If you're going to have trouble wrapping up by 7:00, we'll find somewhere to take a break, do the drawing for the door prizes, and let people leave who need to. After that, you can finish up your presentation.</p>

<h1>Check the equipment</h1>
<p>We start at 6:00. I'm usually there by 5:30. Try to show up at least 15 minutes early to get hooked up to the projector and make sure everything is working. If feasible, I recommend you email me a copy of your presentation ahead of time so that I can have it ready to go on my laptop in case disaster should strike yours: <a href="mailto:rds6235@gmail.com">rds6253@gmail.com</a></p>

<h1>Stay in touch</h1>
<p>Feel free to call or email me with any questions. Especially if you aren't going to be able to make it to the meeting or if you're going to be late for whatever reason, please call and let me know as soon as you can: 210-394-3719 <a href="mailto:rds6235@gmail.com">rds6253@gmail.com</a></p>

<h1>Have fun</h1>
<p>This is an easy crowd. We're all just developers who are interested in learning new stuff. Take a deep breath, relax, and just show us why it's cool.</p>
